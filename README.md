# lt2316-Chinese-character-detection
In this assignment, I take images from a Chinese image database with annotations that indicate where the Chinese characters are, and I train a model that takes test images and superimposes upon them a visualization of the likelihood that a pixel is close to or part of a valid Chinese character.
